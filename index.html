        <h2>Me and My Brothers</h2>
        <h5>Joshua and Nicholas</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
        <p>I live with both of my brothers Nick(18) and Josh(11), out of the two of them my little brother is the one that I connect with then most. Me and my older brother used to be close , but then we drifted apart as we got older with age. when my younger brother was born I was depressed for a while but then I started to like and would always find any chance i could to be with him of take care of him and we have been partners in crime for the last 11 years of our life. My younger brother is almost the same height as me and he likes to remind me of that fact every day, but now that he is older i feel like he can help make his own food and do things around the house more instead of me just being the one that does everything for him. I admit he has grown and starts ding things for himself a little more frequently, but not as much I would like. My older brother likes to try and tell me off but I alwasy win at the end no matter what. He wishes that he was more mature than me but he is not.</p>
        <p>Being the only girl in the family alows me to be pampered whenever my family thinks Im tired. But that also measn that ai have to be the more mature out of the 3 of us, that means I have to cook and clean and make sure that my little brother is actual being and not something that we found on the street.</p>

        <h3>Anything else</h3>
        <p>When me and my younger brother joke around its usually about things that are very serious that we find hilarious, that we probably should find funny at all. Most times though when we are together we always get in trouble no matter what we do, on numerous ocassion my mother had to split me and him up because we could not stop laughing at each other.</p>
